\item Diagonal Matrix Properties
In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix (usually a square matrix) in which 
the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero. The diagonal entries themselves 
may or may not be zero. Thus, the matrix $D = (d_{i,j})$ with n columns and n rows is diagonal 
The time complexity is $O(N^2),  (C_2^N) = O(N^2/2)$.

\section{In Closing}

You have reached the end of this mini-guide. You can now rename or overwrite this pdf file and begin writing your own `\texttt{Chapter1.tex}' and the rest of your thesis. The easy work of setting up the structure and framework has been taken care of for you. It's now your job to fill it out!

Good luck and have lots of fun!
