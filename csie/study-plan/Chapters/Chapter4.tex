\section{Robust Real-time Object Detection}
The Viola-Jones algorithm  \cite{Viola2004RRF966432}, the first ever real-time face detection system. 
There are three ingredients working in concert to enable a fast and accurate detection:
the integral image for feature computation, Adaboost for feature selection and an 
attentional cascade for efficient computational resource allocation. 
Since the Viola-Jones algorithm typically gives multiple detections, 
a post-processing step is also proposed to reduce detection redundancy using a 
robustness argument.\cite{ipol.2014.104}
